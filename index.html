            <h2>Introduction to Sustainable Gardening</h2>
            <p>Sustainable gardening is an approach to cultivating plants that works in harmony with natural ecosystems while minimizing environmental impact. This practice emphasizes the use of organic methods, water conservation, and biodiversity to create thriving gardens that benefit both gardeners and the broader environment.</p>
            
            <p>By adopting sustainable gardening practices, you contribute to soil health, support local wildlife, reduce chemical runoff, and create a more resilient garden ecosystem. This guide will walk you through the fundamental principles and practical techniques needed to transform your garden into a sustainable haven.</p>
            
            <h3>Core Principles of Sustainable Gardening</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Work with natural processes rather than against them</li>
                <li>Build and maintain healthy soil as the foundation of garden health</li>
                <li>Conserve water through efficient irrigation and plant selection</li>
                <li>Support biodiversity by choosing native and pollinator-friendly plants</li>
                <li>Minimize chemical inputs and embrace organic alternatives</li>
                <li>Create closed-loop systems through composting and recycling</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="soil-health">
            <h2>Building and Maintaining Healthy Soil</h2>
            <p>Healthy soil is the cornerstone of any sustainable garden. Rich, living soil supports plant growth, retains moisture, and hosts beneficial microorganisms that contribute to overall garden health.</p>
            
            <h3>Understanding Soil Composition</h3>
            <p>Ideal garden soil consists of approximately 45% mineral particles, 25% water, 25% air, and 5% organic matter. The mineral component includes sand, silt, and clay in balanced proportions, creating what gardeners call "loamy" soil.</p>
            
            <h3>Improving Soil Structure</h3>
            <p>To enhance soil structure naturally, incorporate organic matter such as compost, aged manure, or leaf mold. These materials improve drainage in clay soils and increase water retention in sandy soils while providing essential nutrients for plants.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p>"The nation that destroys its soil destroys itself." - Franklin D. Roosevelt</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <h3>Testing and Monitoring Soil Health</h3>
            <p>Regular soil testing helps you understand your garden's specific needs. Test for pH levels, nutrient content, and organic matter percentage. Most vegetables thrive in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.</p>
        </section>

        <aside>
            <h3>Quick Tip: The Mason Jar Soil Test</h3>
            <p>Want to understand your soil composition at home? Fill a mason jar one-third full with soil, add water until two-thirds full, shake vigorously, and let settle for 24 hours. You'll see distinct layers showing the proportions of sand, silt, and clay in your soil.</p>

        <section id="water-conservation">
            <h2>Water Conservation Strategies</h2>
            <p>Efficient water use is crucial for sustainable gardening, especially in regions facing water scarcity. Smart watering practices not only conserve this precious resource but also promote stronger, more resilient plants.</p>
            
            <h3>Rainwater Harvesting</h3>
            <p>Collecting rainwater provides a free, chemical-free water source for your garden. Simple rain barrels can capture water from roof downspouts, while more elaborate systems can include first-flush diverters and distribution networks.</p>
            
            <h3>Mulching for Moisture Retention</h3>
            <p>Applying a 2-4 inch layer of organic mulch around plants significantly reduces water evaporation from soil surfaces. Effective mulching materials include shredded leaves, straw, wood chips, and grass clippings.</p>
            
            <h3>Drip Irrigation and Soaker Hoses</h3>
            <p>These efficient watering systems deliver water directly to plant roots, minimizing evaporation and reducing water waste. Drip irrigation can reduce water usage by 30-50% compared to conventional sprinkler systems.</p>
            
            <h3>Xerophytic Plant Selection</h3>
            <p>Choosing drought-tolerant plants reduces overall water requirements. Many native plants are naturally adapted to local rainfall patterns and require minimal supplemental watering once established.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="native-plants">
            <h2>The Power of Native Plants</h2>
            <p>Native plants are species that evolved naturally in your specific geographic region. These plants offer numerous advantages for sustainable gardening, including reduced maintenance requirements and enhanced support for local wildlife.</p>
            
            <h3>Benefits of Native Plant Gardening</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Ecological Adaptation</dt>
                <dd>Native plants are perfectly suited to local climate conditions, soil types, and precipitation patterns, requiring minimal intervention once established.</dd>
                
                <dt>Wildlife Support</dt>
                <dd>Native plants provide essential food sources and habitat for local birds, butterflies, bees, and other beneficial insects that have co-evolved with these species.</dd>
                
                <dt>Reduced Resource Requirements</dt>
                <dd>Because they're adapted to local conditions, native plants typically require less water, fertilizer, and pest control than non-native alternatives.</dd>
                
                <dt>Preservation of Local Biodiversity</dt>
                <dd>By cultivating native plants, gardeners help preserve genetic diversity and support conservation efforts for threatened local species.</dd>
            </dl>
            
            <h3>Finding Native Plants for Your Region</h3>
            <p>Research native plants through local extension offices, native plant societies, and botanical gardens. Many regions have specific native plant databases that recommend species based on your exact location and growing conditions.</p>

        <section id="composting">
            <h2>Composting: Nature's Recycling System</h2>
            <p>Composting transforms kitchen scraps and yard waste into nutrient-rich soil amendment, creating a closed-loop system that reduces waste while improving garden health.</p>
            
            <h3>Understanding the Composting Process</h3>
            <p>Composting relies on the activity of microorganisms that break down organic matter in the presence of oxygen. The process requires the right balance of carbon-rich "brown" materials and nitrogen-rich "green" materials.</p>
            
            <h3>Brown Materials (Carbon)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Dry leaves</li>
                <li>Shredded paper and cardboard</li>
                <li>Straw and dried grass clippings</li>
                <li>Wood chips and sawdust</li>
                <li>Pine needles</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Green Materials (Nitrogen)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fresh grass clippings</li>
                <li>Vegetable and fruit scraps</li>
